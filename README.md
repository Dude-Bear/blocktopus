# Blocktopus
## Design and implementation of a website to show the market shares of individual cryptocurrencies
Under the working title Blocktopus, a web application was designed and implemented, which enables the user to get a quick overview of the market shares of individual cryptocurrencies in the overall market and to divide a desired investment within this asset class according to market capitalization.

Many techniques from agile project management and modern software development were used in the planning and programming. A special focus was on the holistic execution of a software development process, which contains all elements from recording the first ideas in a project charter to creating prototypes and then using a complete CI/CD pipeline.

Even if there are still a few optimization possibilities in the development and programming, a helpful application could be developed through the use of various adequate methods and tools, which facilitates orientation in the often confusing crypto market.

A variety of technologies were used to build the application and learn modern tools.
